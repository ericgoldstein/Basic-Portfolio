		<p>Eric was born in Poughkeepsie New York in 1973 to a IBM'er so he moved around the first 13 years of his life till he landed in Boulder Colorado. After heading off to the University of Arizona for school he found the game of golf. This caused a 4 year break from school as he went off to become a Golf Professional. Eventually he went back to school and graduated from Metro State College of Denver in 2010.</p>
